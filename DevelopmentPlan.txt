Hitster Development Plan

Technical Stack:
- Frontend: React Native Web
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Image Storage: Firebase Storage
- Authentication: Firebase Auth
- Deployment: Vercel/Netlify (Web), App Store/Play Store (Mobile)

Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
1. Set up React Native Web project
   - Initialize project with Expo
   - Configure web support
   - Set up shared components structure
   - Configure navigation for both platforms

2. Create basic project structure
   - Set up shared components directory
   - Create platform-specific components where needed
   - Set up API structure
   - Create database schema for news events

Phase 2: Core Game Components
1. Create Timeline Component
   - Implement shared timeline visualization
   - Add platform-specific drag-and-drop (React Native Gesture Handler for mobile, react-draggable for web)
   - Create shared event card component
   - Implement touch and mouse interactions

2. Implement Game Logic
   - Create random event selection system
   - Add timer functionality
   - Implement answer validation
   - Create scoring system

3. Build Basic UI
   - Create mobile-first responsive layout
   - Implement platform-specific navigation
   - Add timer display
   - Create basic navigation

Phase 3: Backend Implementation
1. Set up Database and API
   - Implement MongoDB schema
   - Create Express API endpoints
   - Set up Firebase Storage for images
   - Implement basic validation

2. Create Admin Interface
   - Build cross-platform admin panel
   - Add image upload functionality
   - Implement Firebase authentication
   - Create content management system

Phase 4: Polish and Testing
1. Add Visual Polish
   - Implement platform-specific animations
   - Add loading states
   - Improve responsive design
   - Add visual feedback for interactions

2. Testing and Optimization
   - Test on various devices and platforms
   - Optimize performance for each platform
   - Add error handling
   - Implement basic analytics

Phase 5: Deployment
1. Prepare for Launch
   - Set up production environments
   - Configure deployment pipelines
   - Add monitoring
   - Create documentation

2. Launch MVP
   - Deploy web version
   - Submit mobile apps to stores
   - Monitor usage across platforms
   - Gather feedback
   - Plan next iterations

This revised plan focuses on delivering a truly cross-platform solution while maintaining code quality and following the specified rules. The use of React Native Web allows us to share code between platforms while still providing native performance where needed. Each phase will be implemented incrementally, with regular testing and documentation updates.
