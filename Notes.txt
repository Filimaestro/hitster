I (not Cursor AI) have added the notes and MVP/Rules files to the folder for the AI Agent to keep track of his own changes, improvements and mistakes. 
I'm going to use this as a test to see if we can easily spot mistakes and learn from them. At 9:36 I asked the AI to look at the files in the folder
and create a step by step plan on how to build this tool. I also gave him information on how to update this file.

AI Agent has created a comprehensive development plan in DevelopmentPlan.txt. The plan is structured in 5 phases, focusing on delivering a functional MVP quickly while maintaining code quality. The plan includes all required features from the MVP document and follows a mobile-first approach. Technical stack has been chosen to ensure rapid development and easy deployment.

AI Agent has revised the technical stack and development plan after reconsidering the cross-platform requirements. The new stack uses React Native Web as the primary framework, allowing for a single codebase that works across all platforms (web and native mobile). This change better addresses the requirement for both native app and website support while maintaining a mobile-first approach. The backend stack has been simplified to use Node.js with Express and MongoDB for better flexibility and easier maintenance.
